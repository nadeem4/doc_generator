# DocuFlow

## Overview

**DocuFlow** is a Python tool that automates documentation generation for your Python project. By integrating a powerful code parser with open-source LLMs, DocuFlow can automatically generate:

- Class and function docstrings
- Project-level documentation (README.md)
- Code flow documents that outline the execution order and relationships between classes, functions, and methods
- Contribution guidelines for open-source projects

## Features

- **Automated Documentation**: Uses parsed code data to generate docstrings and documentation files.
- **LLM Integration**: Leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate meaningful and descriptive docstrings.
- **Project-wide Parsing**: Traverses your entire Python project to gather metadata and generate documentation.
- **Code Flow Analysis**: Generates a high-level overview of the flow of your code, showing how different components interact.
- **Contribution Guide**: Generates a CONTRIBUTING.md file for your open-source projects.
